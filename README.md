## Overview

shellPass is a fast, simple, and powerful open-source utility tool designed for generating unique and random passwords in the terminal. This script was authored by me and is compatible with MacOS, GNU/Linux, and WSL2 environments.

The program offers options to customize both the length and complexity of generated passwords. It utilizes the special `/dev/random` folder to ensure the generation of secure and unique passwords.
